Limitless Exchange is a decentralized prediction market platform designed to allow users to trade on the outcomes of real-world and cryptocurrency-related events using natural language conditions, such as “Will Bitcoin reach $65,000 by a specific date?” Built on the Base blockchain, a scalable and cost-efficient Ethereum Layer 2 network developed by Coinbase, Limitless Exchange combines the familiarity of centralized exchange (CEX) trading interfaces with the transparency and security of on-chain infrastructure. The platform has garnered significant attention, boasting over $270 million in total trading volume and securing $7 million in funding from investors like Coinbase Ventures and Paper Ventures as of September 2024.

Unlike traditional sportsbooks or financial betting platforms, Limitless operates as a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace where users trade directly against each other, not the house. This model ensures better odds and lower fees, with the platform generating revenue by taking a small cut of the winnings. The platform supports both market orders (executed at the best available price) and limit orders (set at specific prices), fostering price discovery and flexibility for traders.
